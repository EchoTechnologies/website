                    p The CARPA Initiative fosters the growth of students developing their skills to become engineers and grow as diligent colleagues. As a student-run organization, we are expected to finance independently through fundraisers, sponsorships, and donations from charitable individuals and corporations.
                    p These funds will be utilized to the fullest extent, as they will be used to develop new software, buy and manufacture parts to build our robots, purchase supplies for the mission, impact the community, and leave a legacy for future classes. As appreciation charitable  individuals and organizations will be included in all of our presentations and at our mission exposition in the form of various publications including banners, brochures, websites, and more.
                    p Our goal is to create â€œIdeas Worth hearing that inspire the communities we serve, through the products we develop, and the leaders we cultivate. We hope you choose to contribute to our mission and be a part of our success. Your contribution will have lasting, long-term effects beyond the immediate reward.
